This is Computer Vision based Parking Space Monitoring Program.
The input is a video footage of the area and the parking lots are specified in a yaml file.
The availabilty of the lot is updated in a firebase cloud firestore(beta, at the time of implementation) and the front end app draws data from this datastore.
